	<h1><font size="+6">Welcome to Contact Answer!</font></h1>
	
	<p>Contact Answer is an Answering Services provider for businesses needs to be met via our call center.  </p>
	<p><b><font size="+4">What is an Answering Service?</font></b>

</br>An Answering Service is exactly as it sounds, A person or entity that will take calls on your behalf, the main difference being that we provide it as a service. Here at CONTACT AUTOMATION we believe that each customer should be attended to personally and professionally, which is why we do what we love to do. Reaching out or instilling in customers your brands attitude on customer service is everything from lead generation to dispersement of information. 

 

</br><b><font size="+4">Types of Answering Services provided?</font></b></br>

While there are various types of Answering Services we provide, Our development process is completely customizable. From the script to the toll free number, we can help you gain an understanding of our hybrid model of answering services and why it's essential to what you need. 

First we have Live Answering Services. These allow us to speak personally to your customers without long wait times and then document what can or needs to be done. This is one of our best services as it allows businesses to build to scale and utilize our services instead of having their own call center. With this we can prioritize or document various methods of engagement and let you know exactly what the customer is looking for. 

Secondly, we have Virtual Receptionist Services. This allows our agents to be used for your benefit specifically. We will build a script specialized to you, train an agent(or a few!) and have a purpose built initiative for reaching out to you on ONLY what you would like. 

We also host specialty services for when businesses have to take donations or charities need more manpower than they're capable of hiring. We can host those lines and allow your needs to be met by us, or simply utilize our agents and your own staff. 

You may be asking yourself why this matters, and honestly, it matters because of the principle of connection. If your business can't take a call or has to much calls for the time of day, you get bogged down in customer interaction and not your business. This is a perfect reason why Answering Services is viable for you. Let us handle the customer, you handle the business, and everyone benefits. 

 

</br><b><font size="+4">How can this help my business?</font></b></br>

Did you know that 61% of people actually think that IVR services hinder companies? That's a lot of customers having issues! When we think of Interactive Voice Response and the automation era, we need to think about blending. I'm not talking about blending that makes a good smoothie, although sales numbers would have you believe that this is just as sweet. Our approach is to customize the experience from the Client to the Customer. What we mean is, quite simply, if it can be avoided....avoid it!    

We don't allow redundant data and break points to scour our services. We here at CONTACT AUTOMATION believe that each business we service has the ability to significantly change their customers views of that company easily by allowing their passion and drive to fuel how your business is seen. Automation and IVR services come with so many benefits that we can proudly say that not one of our clients have had a bad experience or have not accomplished the goals they set forth to achieve with our custom IVR and Automation services. Let us take our passion and assist yours with automation today!

Speaking of Data. You've read the latest reports right? Well you certainly should when you receive them from us. We build reports for you based on line usage, inbound and outbound calls, call volume, and much more. This data helps us and our clients understand and continuously develop better practices for your business and it's need to grow. </p>
